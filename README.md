💀 Project Overview

NullSector is a specialized ghost-toolkit developed to explore the boundaries of WAF evasion and automated system cleanup. It bypasses CDN layers to interact directly with origin infrastructures.
🚀 Key Capabilities

    Wiper Protocol: Efficient removal of targeted .apk packages and system logs via os.remove automation.

    Origin-Bypass: Proof-of-concept for direct communication with the origin server at 85.111.76.66, bypassing Cloudflare protections.

    Glitch Logic: Simulation of UI instability and system distortion for stress-testing interfaces.
